# Games
All of the files are games I've made, for tag you'll need to add AirChild2RunSheet.png, AirChildRunSheet.png, and CuriousLabSeshat.jpg.... they made a typo lol
I'm going to be developing new games anytime I have freetime in school, so VERY OFTEN!  Feel free to ask me any questions about how the games work,
also if I see you can't play Tag because there aren't any files, I'm going to laugh at you and call you a loser.  I'm most likely going to add those
files once I get a new computer, and put some of these games on the web instead of on github!  Other than that I hope you like the games!!!
One more thing...  If it has - -, then it's a text game and if it has ! !, it's in HTML!!!
